# Redux Weather App

This is a repo for tracking my steps in the Modern React with Redux Udemy course by Stephen Grider. For this excersize I am going to create a weather app that has a search function for the location and when a location is chosen some weather data is taken from a weather API & showed on my page including some nice graphs used from a third party.

## Current state
Just getting started :-)
